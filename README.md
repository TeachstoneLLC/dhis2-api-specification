# DHIS2 Core API Specification

The DHIS2 Core API Specification document is available for viewing via github pages, here:

[DHIS 2 OpenAPI Specification](https://dhis2.github.io/dhis2-api-specification/)

This default view is based on [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc).

An alternative view, based on [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/jensoleg/swagger-ui) is available here:
[swagger-ui view](https://dhis2.github.io/dhis2-api-specification/swagger-ui/)

## Structure

The specification document is found under /docs/spec/openapi.json

> **Please do not edit the specification file directly**

The source files have been split up to make them a little easier to work with (hopefully).
The starting point is /docs/spec/src/base_openapi.json, and uses JSON references to include files for different elements.

Each source file has the full mandatory structure of an OpenAPI specification (to support linting) and ends with *openapi.json, to support recognition in vs code.

There are a variety of "API editors" out there, but it may be most effective simply to use your favourite editor, which often support linting of the specification, and also have advances features for working with JSON files.

The single spec file is generated by combining the source files with a simple python script.

``` 
cd tools/python
source setup_venv
python3 combine.py
```

*It is also possible to create a single file by running something like json-refs against the base_openapi.json.*

## Status

The specification should be considered a very draft version at the moment.
